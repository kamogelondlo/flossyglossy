        Hello World My name is kamogelo ndlovu.I live in madombidzha.Im
        doing grade 9 at Jonothan Thifulufhelwi Secondary.I could describe
        myself as good  well mannered,beautiful,intelligent and smart girl.What
        i want to do or work as "i want to be a doctor"i love helping people and
        working with numbers especially helping old people.Seeing old people sick
        and not able to find help or can't go to the hospital or clinic,makes
        me see that me being a doctor can make a big difference in many people's
        lives.Helping old people is my everyday wish.I would be glad if i was to
        save many people's lives.It has been my wish i was young to be a doctor.
        I used to play with my lil sis and i was acting as a doctor and at
        school plays i would cry just to play the doctor character.I have two
        friends(wanganae&adivhaho).My role model is Dikelede Ndlovu.She is my
        cousin.She is so successfulwith her studies and she is soo focused with
        her school work.I want to be like her one day.She is studying overseas.
